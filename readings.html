    <li>* "We are not unique in suffering from moral confusion — these crises are a familiar story — but we are unique in the tremendous acceleration of the rate of social change and in the tremendous risk of a catastrophic end to all our hopes." ~ Alan Simpson 
    </li>
    <li>* How concise that you can cry from awful wounds, desertion, happiness, memories, humiliation, disappointment, or grandeur ~ Somewhere in the University of Chicago
    <li>* When Einstein died, his greatest rival Bohr found for him words of moving admiration. When a few years later Bohr in turn died, someone took a photograph of the blackboard in his study. There's a drawing on it. A drawing of the light-filled box' in Einstein's thought experiment. To the very last, the desire to challenge oneself and understand more. And to the very last: doubt.</li>
        * Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, o descendent of bharata, and a predominant rise of adharma - at that time I descend myself. ~ Krishna…. Beware of putting too much stock in your heroes. greatness is a transitory phenomenon. it is never consistent. the gods briefly act through Men and then leave them to their ordinary fate. ~roon </li>
        * It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt reusable rockets will work, in large part because of the stress the machines and metal go through during launch. It's not clear that the most prized customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches due to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and companies have not pursued the technology. There's a camp of space experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his time, and that engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a fool's errand. ~ A note from 2016 </li>
        * There's a type of person that doesn't get discouraged even if they make the wrong move five times in a row. They stay passionate about the problem; they stay passionate about trying Lto find a solution. They keep on executing and moving forward"~ Paul Graham to Michael Jordan, Bulls vs Jazz 1998 NBA Finals</li>
