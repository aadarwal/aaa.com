        <p>I currently study Physics and Philosophy at the University of Chicago. <a href="mailto:aadarsh@uchicago.edu"> [aadarsh@uchicago.edu] </a>/ @aadarwal on <a href="https://github.com/aadarwal">github</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aadarwal">X</a>.</a></p>

        <h3>Poker</h3>
        <p> Things that I find really interesting: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Propulsion</li>
            <li>Learning processes</li>
            <li>Computing</li>
            <li>Climate Engineering</li>
            <li>India</li>
        </ul>
        Here is <a href="/poker.html">why</a>

        <h3>Work + Side Quests</h3>
        <p>Things that emerged from these interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://highlab.uchicago.edu/"> High Lab, Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering: </a>The University of Chicago has <a href="www.chicagoqunatumexchange.com">hedged bets</a> with its quantum research push. 
                I am particularly interested in the cryptography and communication aspects of this research, particularly the role that such satellites would play in the future. The High Lab is based a lot around building materials like diamond at the nanoscale for such applications and I currently 
                am trying to learn as much from research on the same. 
            <li> <a href="https://skyroot.in">Skyroot Aerospace: </a> Skyroot probably does some of the coolest research happening in India right now, and it was great to learn from some special people there. Not only is their success important for
             India's development of competitive launch capabilities, but I would guess more so that such ambitious research projects could actually realize sets great precendent. 
            <li> e-acc.in: India needs technical inspiration - this is what I am trying to build then. </li>
            <li> pascal: the future of events and there is a way to naturalize llms into a very special focus imo. there 
                is some need for this from what i can see then. This is definitely something i want to work on then. </li>
            <li> bhabha: I am trying to use lisp to create something like flightclub.com both because I feel that there is definitely scope 
                for interests in such data, but also because lisp was very interesting to learn and apply to something like this. 

        </ul>
